# pride-ocarina
An arduino nano based queer electronic ocarina
This was supposed to be used in a pride related workshop where I would spark curiosity with a little electronic soldering course.
The circuit do 2 things. First it has animated leds that shows queer flag colors with animation.
Second it's an electric ocarina based on the 6 holes kind.
It's engineered in a way that it's easy to understand and solder, not to be elegant.
The workshop hasn't been approved so I will keep this unfinished work for maybe a futur pride event.

Here is how it looks like at the moment:
